# Digital-Clock

 To use the simple digital clock application, follow these steps:

Open the index.html file in your web browser.

You will see a digital clock displayed on the screen.

The clock will automatically update every second to show the current time in the format "HH:mm:ss" (hours:minutes:seconds).

That's it! The clock will keep running and updating the time as long as you have the web page open in your browser. It provides a basic and continuous display of the current time.
